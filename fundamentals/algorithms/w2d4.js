// isPalindrome(str) -> input is a single string (str). function returns true if
// the input is a palindrome and false otherwise.
// a palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards or backwards
// for this example, capitalization and other punctuation matter
// "racecar" is a palindrome
// "raCecar" is not (a capital C is not the same as a lowercase c)
// "race car" is not (the space doesn't match up with the E on the opposite side)

function isPalindrome(str) {

// what are our test cases?
